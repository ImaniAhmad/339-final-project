    <h1>ðŸ•Œ Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·</h1>

    <p class="info">In Summer of 2022, we traveled to Istanbul, Turkey. While the flight was one of the longest I've ever taken (13 hours!!), it was truly worth it. The architecture and history of the city was breathtaking, with beautiful domed mosques every few blocks. <br><br> One of my favorite spots in Istanbul would have to be the Hagia Sophia, a mosque that was originally a church built in the 6th century by the Byzantines and features ornate decorative minarets, mosaics, and arabic calligraphy. Another amazing part of Istanbul was the delicious food, both savory and sweet, that the city had to offer. From tender meat that melts off the bone to flaky Baklava pastries served with Turkish ice cream or fragrant tea, there are thousands of different foods to try that will satisfy any craving. Another of my favorite spots was the Topkapi Palace, a palace and museum dedicated to the history of the Ottoman Empire. We were able to explore the grounds and witness the beautiful lifestyle the palace's residents must have lived, with lavish throne rooms, amazing views of the city, and picturesque gardens. <br><br> Overall, traveling to Istanbul was a life changing experience, and I would go back in a heartbeat!</p>
