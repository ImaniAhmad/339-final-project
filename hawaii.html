    <h1>ðŸŒº Hawaii ðŸŒŠ</h1>

    <p class="info">In Winter of 2021, We traveled to two of Hawaii's many islands: Oahu, and Maui. While I had already heard many good things about Hawaii from friends, actually being there in person was nothing like I could've imagined. From black sand beaches, to snorkeling, to fresh cut fruit, it was a tropical heaven and my family didn't want to leave. <br><br> The first island we visited was Oahu. While the island is known for being quite touristy, especially Waikiki, Oahu's North Shore was one of my favorite parts of the entire trip. The North Shore has amazing green mountains that tower over you on one side (these are where Jurassic Park was filmed), while the blue ocean, sandy beaches, and palm trees stretched across the other. It was amazing to see surfers riding massive waves, and stopping by beachside shacks for fresh acai bowls and smoothies. <br><br> Maui was an amazing display of nature. From driving up the massive volcano Haleakala and biking down, to snorkeling and sunbathing on the island's 30 miles of beaches, we were constantly outdoors and enjoying the beautiful sunshine. One of my favorite parts of Maui was the Road to Hana, which is a 70 mile stretch of highway that takes you through some of Maui's most beautiful regions in the mountains. We were able to swim in waterfalls, see breathtaking views from high above the clouds, and hike and explore interesting flora of the state such as the Hibiscus and mangrove trees. Overall, Hawaii is a must-visit and I hope to explore the rest of its' rich islands in the future.</p>
