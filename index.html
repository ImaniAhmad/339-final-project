    <h1>Imani's Travels</h1>

    <p>Hi, I'm Imani, a Junior at the University of Michigan! This website highlights two of my favorite places I have traveled to with my family. As someone who loves all types of travel, from adventurous locations with hiking and snorkeling, to locations with rich and beautiful history and monuments, my recommendations will have something interesting for every personality!</p>
